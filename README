Set of build tools including ant build file for most of my projects

For use on windows platform use jplinker.bat

The following is some notes and not a coherent set of usage instructions which I will put in place when time avails...

Usage:

1. to link an extension project (called jbetolo living inside the source dir) inside your website project (called wwwn living in the target dir) issue 
- jplinker jbetolo wwwn git

(NOTE: the last argument git indicates the source version control system employed for the extension project as I have my local forks of each system in separate folder)

2. ant build file for the sake of use in netbeans exists and the linked file is renamed to .ant in order for netbeans to recognize it properly
